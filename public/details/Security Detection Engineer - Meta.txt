About the job
As part of Meta Security, our Insider Trust team is focused on identifying and responding to insider threats to data. The team's mission is to identify malicious use of otherwise legitimate access to data from people inside the company and respond to it before damage is done. We investigate across a broad spectrum of abuse including abuse of user data, intellectual property, and leaks of sensitive information. We collaborate with software engineering teams to build advanced detection capabilities and understand how abuse happens so that we can stay ahead of those who are interested in misusing their access.
